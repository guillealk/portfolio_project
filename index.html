            <p class ="cover__paragraph"> I am a System Engineer with 
             specialization in Software Architecture, Software Design, and 
             Software Development. I have a bachelor degree in System 
             Engineering from the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de 
             Caldas, Colombia. Furthermore, I have recently completed an 
             European master in Software Engineering from two universities: 
             the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain and the Technische 
             Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany. From my studies, I have 
             gained knowledge in Information Systems, primarily related to 
             Software Engineering, System Modeling Language, UML, Enterprise 
             Architect, Java Development, as well as Embedded System, Model 
             Based System Engineering, Interaction Design, User Experience, 
             Agile Development, Database Management and Programming Languages 
             skills.
            </p> 
           
            <p class ="cover__paragraph">For the past three years, I have 
             been working as an intern at different research institutes. 
             First, I worked as GIS Developer Analyst Intern at Fundación 
             Parque Tecnológico de Itaipu-Paraguay where I designed and 
             developed software architecture for different Geographic 
             Information System projects. Then, I worked as Software 
             Architecture Researcher Intern at Fraunhofer IESE, where the 
             focus of my research for my master thesis was on Software Product 
             Line and System Modeling Language for my master thesis. 
             Currently, I am still working as a researcher intern at 
             Fraunhofer IESE in the areas of Internet of Things, Industrial 
             Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems. The aim of this 
             research is to obtain a better understanding of the mentioned 
             topics and comprehend the possibilities of applying them to 
             the industry.
            </p>

            <p class ="cover__paragraph">Therefore, from my working 
            experience, I developed a variety of skills needed for supporting 
            the development and maintenance of software projects, as well as, 
            for working successfully with a diversity of stakeholders, 
            customers, and end-users.
